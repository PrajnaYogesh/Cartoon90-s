        <p class="about" id="about-p"> Sailor. Tough-guy. Hero. Legend.
            That's Popeye. An underdog with bulging forearms, a mean uppercut and a love of canned spinach. Unassuming, unsophisticated and undeterred by a challenge, from the minute he walked into the comic strip, THIMBLE THEATER, and muttered his famous “Ja think I’m a cowboy?” line, Popeye the Sailor Man captured the hearts of millions of fans around the globe. As the star of his own comics strips and animated series on the big screen and small, Popeye became quickly ingrained in American culture, and today remains one of the most recognizable pop-culture icons in the world.</p>

        <p class="about" id="about-t"> Tom and Jerry is an American animated media franchise and series of comedy short films created in 1940 by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Best known for its 161 theatrical short films by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the series centers on the rivalry between the titular characters of a cat named Tom and a mouse named Jerry. </p>
